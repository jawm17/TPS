          <p>
            Texas Pool Services was created to fill a void in the Austin area
            "Pool Company". Most companies focus on one area of excellence but
            we believe that doing it all sets us apart, so we specialize in it
            all. Texas Pool Services also believes education in this market is
            and has been lacking. Most "Pool Guys" will tell you their opinion
            and not follow the proven science your pool needs. We focus on
            education, not only ours but yours too! The more we all know the
            longer your hard earned money will last. Call Today to learn the
            Texas Pool Services way!
